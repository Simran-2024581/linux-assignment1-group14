1)Difference between the Linux kernel and the shell

The kernel is the core of the Linux operating system.
It controls hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and devices and provides the basic services that programs need to run.
The shell is the command-line program that lets users type commands and interact with the kernel.

2)An absolute path is the complete path to a file or directory starting from the root /. It shows the location of a file in the file system no matter where you are.
Example: /home/student/linux-assignment1/docs/notes.txt

A relative path shows the location of a file or directory starting from the current working directory. It depends on where you are in the folder structure.
Example: docs/notes.txt 

3)Core components of Linux

Kernel – the central part of the OS that manages hardware and system resources.

Shell – the user interface (command interpreter) that passes commands to the kernel.

File system – the structure that organizes and stores all data.

System utilities and applications – tools and programs that allow users to perform tasks such as file management, networking, and process control.
